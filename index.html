        <h1><span class="highlight">Hello, I'm Eoin</span></h1>
        <p class="narrow-paragraph">
        I have a masters degree in mechanical engineering and this is where I found my passion for combining maths with coding 
        which has now led me to working as a data scientist. I'm grateful to get to do work I actually find interesting and I am
        always trying to get better at what I do. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="center-heading">My Work Experience</h2>
        <p class="narrow-paragraph">
        I have nearly two years experience as a data science consultant working across
        mainly the pharmaceutical and utilities industries. I have had the chance to develop innovative generative AI solutions
        for clients as well as deploying traditional machine learning models into production environments. I am most experienced in SQL
        and Python
    </p>
    <p class="narrow-paragraph">This portfolio includes personal projects, college assignments and a bit of information on projects I've been involved in at work. 
    Some are focused on data collection, others machine learning, and others on engineering simulation which although
    isn't strictly data science was really what piqued my interest in solving mathematical problems using programming (also getting
    these simulations to work involved A LOT of data science in order to debug the code running the simulation).
